# HomeLink Programming for Ford Mustang Mach-E

**Note:** Ford instructions present this as either Step A or Step B, but you need to do **both** steps.

**Important:** Start the car in "full accessory mode" by pressing the start button without pressing the brake pedal.

## Step A: Train the Button in the Car

1. Press and hold the two outer HomeLink buttons until the indicator light begins to flash (up to 20 seconds). Skip this step when training additional buttons.

2. Position the hand-held transmitter 1-3 inches away from the HomeLink surface (visor, overhead console, or mirror). / Unsure where the transmitter antenna is at this time /

3. Simultaneously press and hold both the desired HomeLink button and the hand-held transmitter button. DO NOT release until the HomeLink indicator light flashes slowly and then rapidly. When the indicator light flashes rapidly, both buttons may be released. (The rapid flashing indicates successful training.) 

## Step B: Train the Garage Door Opener

4. On the garage door motorhead, press and release the learn code button (LED may blink on some models).

5. Get back in the vehicle and press the desired HomeLink button once.

6. Press the HomeLink button a second time.

7. Press the HomeLink button a third time. The garage door should open/close. Programming complete!
